# Assignment-1
Multi Page Website - HTML &amp; CSS

For assignment 1 I created a Multi Page Website

This assignment was to test both my newly acquired HTML and CSS skills AND my page and code design. 

The subject matter was entirely up to me - I was suggested to utilizing my design from the previous course as this will reinforce the connection between design and development - but I are free to do whatever I wanted. If I couldnt think of content I could use lorem ipsum. The content itself would not be graded, only the organization, structure and coding of the pages will be graded. 

NOTE. The final assignment in the module will involve the creation of the site I designed in the previous course, so I could use this as a prototype.
